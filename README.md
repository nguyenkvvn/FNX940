by nguyenkvvn
minor geometry referenced from the FNS940 model by TMS

## Description
The FNX is a polymer hammer-fired pistol availible in 9mm and .40 S&W. It is a precursor to the FNS series of pistols. It uses plates for rails, rather than a monolithic locking block or integrated into the fire-control housings. It is only availible commercially in full-size configuration.

Geometry that was referenced from the FNS940 model by TMS includes but is not limited to: magazine button cut-out, magazine button spring relief, trigger pin location.

## Materials Required
You will need a set of each below for each FNX-9/40 you make.

This model is compatible with any FNX-9 or FNX-40 parts kit. It is *not* compatible with the FNX-45 or FNX-45 Tactical.
